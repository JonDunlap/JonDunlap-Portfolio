Once the API was built out we switched over to creating the front end, we were provided with HTML files that we then converted into Pug templates and created the routes for the web server that would show the appropriate pages.

This is one project that I was particularly proud of since everything came together very nicely and I was able to make the authentication function as intended protecting the routes on the server. For the React version, with the separation of the servers, we are now using higher order components to handle the API interactions with the server and passing the returned data as props to the main component. Since we are now making API calls from the browser we also had to implement cross-origin resource sharing(CORS) to prevent errors when requesting data from our API.

        My name is Jon and I am an Army veteran with 11 years of service and a
        recent graduate of Full Sail University's Bachelors of Science degree in
        Web Development. I am a recipient of multiple awards for my dedication
        to duty and ability to work as part of a team, most recently I have been
        awarded the course director's award from Full Sail for my contribution
        to my courses.

        I was born in Rockford Illinois and was a child of a military family so
        I am used to moving and I really enjoy traveling and seeing new things.
        I moved to Thailand over 3 years ago to live with my wife and our
        children, we have spent a lot of our time traveling around and seeing
        everything that beautiful Thailand has to offer. We are currently in the
        process of moving to the US so that our children can continue their
        education and I can pursue my development passions.

        I am excited to bring my skills and talents to the team and to be a part
        of creating projects for people to use, I love to learn from others and
        to help when and where I can, I also love making things work and being
        part of a team that makes this happen is where I excel. I look forward
        to being a part of your team and working together to make great things
        happen.
